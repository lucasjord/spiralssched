Schedules for the SPiRALS experiment series, including trigonometric parallax observations, test observations, compactness observations and 3D distance observations.

Experiments are organised in "years", which are pseudo-arbitrarily grouped from when we start-stop large observations blocks. In 2023 we are starting year3 in Sept-Oct and expect to finish the same time 2024.
